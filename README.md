#### Instructions:

Create a project using create-react-app and add two components Home and History. The navigation should occur without any reload between these two pages. Using the NavLink component in a navigation bar, change the "current page" link to red when the URL coincides with the link.

The Home component must display Welcome to Home and the History component must display Our Story.

The links should be "/" for the Home component, and "/our-history" for the History component
